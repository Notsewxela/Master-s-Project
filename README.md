# Master-s-Project 
## "Modelling Optical and UV Radiation Emitted from Accretion Disks around Supermassive Black Holes"
The output of all my work for my final project as part of my Master's Physics with Astronomy Degree from the University of Southampton, for which I received a First Class award. I was also fortunate enough to receive an award for the highest scoring Master's Project in the Physics department for the academic year 2020/2021, with a score of well over 90% for the contents of my work, one mid-project report, two output reports and a viva-style interview.

For the project I derived some equations that cannot be found in the literature anywhere and implemented them as a model of the system in question. I then compared my model predictions to real data from the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4593.

The code of interest is likely the file named `"Disk Reprocessing Response Function FINAL USE THIS ONE.py"`as this contained the bulk of the final model. Included in this repository are my other attempts at the model, aiming to show my progress as I reached the final results shown in the main report.

For anyone wishing to read a summary of the project, the report they should read is `"[Phys 6006_Summary][Alexander Weston][Modelling the UV and Optical Emission from Accretion Disks around Supermassive Black Holes].pdf"`. For anyone wishing to read a more in-depth dive into the project (including some of the derivations involved that were later implemented into the model), the report named `"[Phys 6006][Alexander Weston][Modelling the UV and Optical Emission from Accretion Disks around Supermassive Black Holes].pdf"` would be more suitable.
